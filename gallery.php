                <p>
                    Welcome to our gallery! Here we are going to have pictures<br>
                    of every national park we visit on our journey! Right now<br>
                    we only have photos from our Acadia trip, but so this page<br>
                    doesn't look completely empty, I am going to include some<br>
                    pictures from our next two parks, The Great Smoky Mountains<br>
                    and Shenandoah National Parks! We are planning to go in<br>
                    the summer of 2024, so check back then for our own, authentic<br>
                    pictures. Under each photo, you will find a short description of<br>
                    what you are looking at, along with my personal experience under<br>
                    the Acadia ones. Hope you enjoy!

                    <p>
                        The first photo on the left is Jordan Pond. Jordan<br>
                        Pond is a large pond in the central area of the island<br>
                        that Acadia is home to. It has a house and apparantly<br>
                        the water is clean enough to drink straight out of!<br>
                        The North and South Bubble are two middle sized<br>
                        mountains that overlook Jordan Pond, and Eagle Lake.<br>
                        They are about 700 feet in the air and have breathtaking<br>
                        views! The third photo is on Maine's coast, as it<br>
                        looks out to the Atlantic Ocean. It is a beautiful<br>
                        and uncommon mix of forest and ocean meeting, and it<br>
                        felt surreal to be there. That personally was my<br>
                        favorite spot in Acadia.

                <h2>Smoky Mountains</h2>
                <p>
                    Located in Gatlinburg, TN (small city right outside<br>
                    Knoxville), the Smoky Mountains are one of the most<br>
                    popular National Parks out there. One of the main<br>
                    attractions, and the one I am looking forward to<br>
                    the most, is Clingsman Dome. Clingsman Dome is<br>
                    a seven mile hike that leads up to a observatory<br>
                    that over looks SEVEN states. Thats right, from<br>
                    Clingsman Dome you can see Tennessee, Kentucky,<br>
                    Virgina, North and South Carolina, Georgia and<br>
                    Alabama. And if you're brave enough, the view<br>
                    at night is so far high up and far away from any<br>
                    major cities that you can see EVERYTHING. I am<br>
                    very excited to go!

                <h2>Shenandoah</h2>
                <p>
                    I don't have much information about Shenandoah,<br>
                    I actually just recently found out it was a National<br>
                    Park (US geography is not my strong suit). But looking<br>
                    at these photos I am very excited. We plan to go all to<br>
                    the Smoky Mountains first, and then visit Shenandoah on<br>
                    the way back to Vermont, as you have to actually go<br>
                    through it to get back here! I will update this section<br>
                    when we finally go in May, but until then I can only<br>
                    share these photos that I found, enjoy!
