        <h3>Hotel:</h3>
        <p>
            Me and my girlfriend stayed in a little motel directly outside <br>
            the bridge to get to the island. This hotel was called "Island View <br>
            Hotel Bar Harbor". It costed us, at the time in August, $220 per night.
        </p>
        <h3>Park Fees</h3>
        <p>
            The park fee to use and park our car around the park <br>
            costed $30 for 7 days of access!
        </p>
        <h3>Food</h3>
        <p>
            There is a lot of seafood places, specifically lobster. <br>
            If you love seafood and lobster, you can expect to spend <br>
            anywhere from $100 to $150 a day in meals. There is still <br>
            a shopping district that have your normal fast food places <br>
            if that is what you prefer!
