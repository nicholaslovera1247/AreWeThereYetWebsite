                <h2>How Did National Parks Start?</h2>
                <p>
                    In 1872, Congress established Yellowstone National Park.<br>
                    The reason for this was for "The benefit and enjoyment<br>
                    of the people". This movement made my the US at the time<br>
                    sparked a movement by many other nations, with more than<br>
                    100 countries having over 1,200 national parks or<br>
                    preserves. In the US, National Parks now take up<br>
                    over 400 areas, which equates to over 84 million<br>
                    acres. The National Parks are some of the most<br>
                    beautiful spots in the world, and if you can ever<br>
                    go to one I would highly encourage it. Even if you're<br>
                    not a hiker, the National Parks have carved out hiking<br>
                    paths for even the most beginner of beginner of hikers.<br>
